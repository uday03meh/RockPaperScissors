## About The Project

A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. 

Rules:

- 🪨Rock beats ✂️Scissors.
- ✂️Scissor beats 📄Paper.
- 📄Paper beats 🪨Rock.

If both players choose the same shape the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
